    "FLAN-T5 released with the [Scaling Instruction-Finetuned Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11416.pdf) paper is an enhanced version of T5 that has been finetuned in a mixture of tasks. The paper explores instruction finetuning with a particular focus on (1) scaling the number of tasks, (2) scaling the model size, and (3) finetuning on chain-of-thought data. The paper discovers that overall instruction finetuning is a general method for improving the performance and usability of pretrained language models.\n",

It is responsible for loading the model and handling the inference request. If you are used to deploying Hugging Face Transformers that might be new to you. Usually, we just provide the `HF_MODEL_ID` and `HF_TASK` and the Hugging Face DLC takes care of the rest. For `FLAN-T5-XXL` thats not yet possible. We have to provide the `inference.py` file and implement the `model_fn` and `predict_fn` functions to efficiently load the 11B large model. \n",
